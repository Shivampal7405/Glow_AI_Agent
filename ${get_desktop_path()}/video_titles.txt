Based on the screenshot provided, it is **not possible to extract the titles of the first 3 videos**.

The screenshot shows a code editor (VS Code) running a program called "GLOW," an AI agent. While the terminal logs show that the agent was tasked with a workflow to "Search YouTube for 'AI trends 2025' and read the first 3 video titles," the process appears to have encountered an error before completion.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what is visible:

*   **The Terminal Status:** The logs show the agent successfully opened YouTube and typed the search query. However, it then encountered a **"[FAIL]" message**: "PyAutoGUI fail-safe triggered from mouse moving to a corner of the screen."
*   **The Content:** The image shows the application's source code, a `QUICK_START.md` guide, and the command-line interface. The actual YouTube search results or the titles of the videos were never displayed on the screen.
*   **The Context:** The text you likely see regarding the "first 3 video titles" is within the **Example Workflows** section of the documentation (`QUICK_START.md`) and in the terminal as part of the initial task instruction, but not as final data output.
