4. **Save Work**: "Save this to a file called notes.txt on my desktop"

### Troubleshooting

#### "API Key Invalid"
- Check you copied the entire key (no spaces)
- Make sure the key is from the correct provider (Groq/Gemini/Claude)
- Generate a new key if needed

#### "GLOW Won't Start"
- Right-click GLOW icon → Run as Administrator
- Check if antivirus is blocking it
- Restart your computer

#### "Command Not Working"
- Try rephrasing your request
- Be more specific about what you want

### Advanced Features

#### Vision Mode (Gemini Only)
GLOW can actually SEE your screen!

```
"Look at my screen and analyze this chart"

"Extract the key points from what's visible"
```

#### Result Chaining
GLOW remembers previous steps:

"Analyze the chart on my screen, summarize the findings,
 and save them to report.txt on my desktop"
